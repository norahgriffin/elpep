## Details of CPS Microdata Development

The sample is restricted to families of head of householders. This is practically driven by the availability of family income as available only for those individuals who are related to the head of household.

```{r read in cps data and documentation}
cps_documentation <- read_ipums_ddi(glue("{input_path}{cps_raw}.xml"))

if (FALSE) {
  ipums_view(cps_documentation)
}
```

```{r view variables relevant to subsetting years for cps, results = "asis", eval = developer_mode}
if (print_documentation) {
  show_ipums_doc(cps_documentation, 
                 fields = c("FAMINC", "ASECFLAG", "STATEFIP", "RELATE"))
}
```

Hawaii and Alaska are dropped, as they follow different federal poverty guidelines than other states, and are expected to have clearly distinct economic dynamics.

<!-- Note that subsetting to match households with both pre and post measures only occurs later, at the point that the method calculates transition ratios. We perform this match--and implicit subsetting--at that stage because a range of choices is may be reasonable and we save the application of discretion for that later stage. -->

```{r read and subset cps microdata}
cps <- fread(file = glue("{input_path}{cps_raw}.csv.gz"))
cps_sub <- 
  cps %>% 
  .[CPSID != 0 &                           # This rules out ASEC over-sample households (see documentation on `CPSID`)
    (ASECFLAG == 2 | is.na(ASECFLAG))  &   # This excludes March ASEC sample 
                                           # Using both ASEC and monthly causes some issues -- e.g., generate WTFINL == NA for March ASEC; double counts individuals for March
                                           # See https://cps.ipums.org/cps/cps_linking_documentation.shtml

  dplyr::select(-COUNTY, -OCC, -CLASSWKR, -FAMID) # dropping variables not currently used.

In short, because this implies that the head of household has no spouse present for whom FAMINC would ostensibly represent a combined income, we treat them as would-be single filers. -->

```{r develop family information relevant to calculating adjusted income and poverty status}
# Assigning filing status
## Single - Anyone with MARST == 3, 4, 5, 6, and no qualifying person
## MFJ - Anyone with MARST == 1, 2
## HOH - Anyone with MARST == 3, 4, 5, 6 with a qualifying person

# Note on qualifying person: 
## A qualifying person includes but not limited to a qualifying child
## A qualifying child is one's (1) own child, step child, foster child, etc.; (2) (under age 19) OR (under age 24 & a full-time student); (3) (single) OR (married and can be claimed as a dependent)
## Although non-kids (e.g., siblings, parents) can be qualifying persons for determining tax filing status, it is difficult to tell whether non-kids meet the requirements from the data. Since most of the qualifying persons are kids, we only count kids
## See `Qualifying Child` section from https://www.irs.gov/publications/p501#en_US_2022_publink1000220823

# Note on Married Filing
## An individual can file MFJ or MFS if they are married 
## This code assumes MFJ if one is married -- which is reasonable based on the IRS statistics -- According to IRS tax statistics, for tax year 2020, 93.4% of [MFJ+MFS] filed jointly and 6.6% filed separately.

### Adjustment for Economic Impact Payments

A key measure for development is family income, which at follow-up is used to determine eligibility for programming. The family income measure represented in the basic monthly file, FAMINC, is documented as *"...the total combined income during the past 12 months for all members of the householder's family. The questionnaire says that 'This includes money from jobs, net income from business, farm or rent, pensions, dividends, interest, social security payments and any other money income received' by members of the householder's family who are 15 years of age or older.* From investigation of patterns of income stability and employment status, it seems clear that federal Economic Impact Payments were included in this amount. However, eligibility for child care supports do not include these amounts. **\]Direct citation is necessary.\]**

The first round of federal stimulus was signed on March 27, 2020 and [provided for](https://www.aarp.org/politics-society/advocacy/info-2020/coronavirus-stimulus-checks.html):

* \$1,200 for single adults, and \$2,400 for married
* \$500 for each child under 17
* A 5% reduction in these benefits for every dollar earned over \$75,000 for individual, \$112,500 for heads of household, and \$150,000 for married joint filers /!\\ Note that the source only directly describes the benefit for individuals as reducing according to this schedule

The timing of these payments was not precise. Given a mid-May deadline to submit banking information--after which individuals would receive a paper check rather than direct deposit, the timing of receipt is roughly assumed to be May 2020 although this likely varies meaningfully.

The second round of federal stimulus was signed on March 27, 2020 and [provided for](https://www.aarp.org/money/taxes/info-2020/second-stimulus-checks.html):

* \$600 for single adults, and \$1,200 for married 
* \$600 for each child 16 or younger (/!\\ note that, per the current source, it is ambiguous whether this is the same or different than the previous threshold)
* A 5% reduction in these benefits for every dollar earned over \$75,000 for individual, \$112,500 for heads of household, and $150,000 for married joint filers /!\\ Note that the source only directly describes the benefit for individuals as reducing according to this schedule

Timing of payment for the second Economic Impact Payment was more tightly controlled than in the first round, and was set for payment on December 30th, 2020. We assume that this income was received as of January 2021.

The third round of federal stimulus was issued starting in March 2021 and [provided for](https://www.aarp.org/money/taxes/info-2021/third-stimulus-checks.html):

* \$1,400 for single adults, and \$2,800 for married
* \$1,400 for each eligible dependent, including adult dependents
* Full amount of the payment for \$75,000 for single filers, \$112,500 for head of household, and \$150,000 for married joint filers. (https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/third-economic-impact-payment)
* Reduction of amounts with full phase-out at \$80,000 for single filers, \$120,000 for head of household, and \$160,000 for married joint filers. This implied a significantly higher rate of phase-out, and one that is variable (https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/more-details-about-the-third-round-of-economic-impact-payments)
* Removal of age cap -- all qualifying kids (not just under 17) were eligible for the third stimulus check

With some exceptions, the majority of this Economic Impact Payment was sent as of March 30, 2021. We assume that this income was received as of April 2021.

These payments were based on adjusted gross income (AGI) from 2019, or AGI from 2020 for the third payment if households had filed in time for consideration (as presumably it would benefit many households to do so). For simplicity, we assume that income at the baseline month is representative of this basis for determining eligibility.

<!-- /!\ Revisit this -- this can likely be improved, especially considering the third economic payment -->

While eligibility for child care programs excludes consideration of the EIPs, it does consider UI benefits as income. Below, we compare our adjusted income measure to that of income plus UI benefits from the CPS's Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC).

### Build CCDF Eligibility Flags

Develop flags for eligibility of child care subsidies through the federal Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF). Locally, the Illinois [Child Care Assistance Program (CCAP)](https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=30355) is available to families based on criteria that include the following:

* live in the state, 
* are employed and/or attending an eligible educational activity
* haver children younger than 13 that need care during the adult work or school hours, or children with documented special needs up to age 19
* have family income below [allowable limits](https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=118832), representing income below 200% of the federal poverty line for initial eligibility, and below 250% of FPL for 12-month redetermination

The [Child Care Assitance Program Policy Manual](https://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=9877) has detail around eligibility, including exempt and non-exempt income.

```{r develop flags for CCDF/CCAP eligibility}

# - 34 NILF, other -- from description, this includes "other activities attending school or keeping house"
  # ... we may seek corroboration from the education supplement to discriminate between NILF discouraged/keeping house, and NILF attending school/training

# In the Education supplement--generally assessed in October, though not in October 21 for some reason (at least in IPUMS records)

### CPS Baseline Measures

Relevant measures at baseline, when households first enter the CPS:

* Presence population of interest, specifically being aged 0-5, and residence in metro area
* Age group, within ages 0-5
* Detailed category of income-to-poverty ratio
* Vulnerability of head-of-household's industry, if working
* Other categories--e.g. race, education--of often-relevant context
