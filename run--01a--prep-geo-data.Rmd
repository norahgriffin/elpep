the presence of necessary objects in the global environment and running 
related scripts if not, or also as a child to the "main-doc". For that latter
reason, comments and headings that are not relevant to a final report to
pubic audiences are suppressed or moved to code chunks that can optionally be 
`echo`ed as desired. -->
