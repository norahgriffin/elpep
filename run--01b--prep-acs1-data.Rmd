## Details of ACS 1-Year Microdata Development

```{r read in acs1 data and documentation}
my_pums <- 
  pums_variables %>% 
  filter(year == 2019, # base_year, ... currently using 2019 because 2021 documentation is not yet available for the current version of tidycensus
         survey == "acs1"
  )

acs1_save_file <- glue("{input_path}census_acs1_{base_year}.csv")
if (!file.exists(acs1_save_file)) {
  source("pull--acs1-microdata.R")
} else {
  acs1 <- fread(file = acs1_save_file)
}


```


```{r review acs documentation}
# Codebook for full and interactive codebook can be viewed by running the `View(pums_variables)`
# command. However, this cannot render within an .Rmd file, so it is here 
# enclosed in an `if` that will not run when the document is knit
if (FALSE) {
  View(my_pums)
}
```

ACS 1-Year microdata are subset to households not living in group quarters, to `r my_state_abbr` records, and to year `r base_year`.

```{r subset microdata}

# Sample restricted to housing unit only
my_state_fip = 6

acs1 <- 
  acs1[TYPE %in% c(1) &
         ST == my_state_fip &
         YEAR == max(YEAR)]

# If county has been specified, load geographic data to perform subsetting to
# relevant PUMAs
if (exists("my_county")) {
  load(glue("{output_path}geo_data_{my_output_tag}.Rda"))
  acs1 <- acs1[PUMA %in% geo_crosswalk$PUMA]

### Prepare the Family-Level Records

Although child records include family income information sufficient to establish eligibility for Head Start and Preschool For All, eligibility for the Child Care Assistance Program (CCAP) requires information on whether adults in the household are engaged in qualifying activities, either work or education.

Note that this information is not strictly necessary to develop for the baseline sample, as the baseline must only establish "vulnerability" to become eligible. However, information about parent activities related to CCAP-eligibility may well be meaningful vulnerabilities.

```{r view variables relevant to constructing household-level measures, eval = developer_mode, results = "asis"}
if (print_documentation) {
  show_ipums_doc(acs_documentation, 
               fields = c("RELSHIPP", #"RELATED", # Note: currently no info on detailed  relationship in Census data (versus our original source of IPUMS)
                          "SCH", "ESR" #, "EMPSTATD"
                          ))
